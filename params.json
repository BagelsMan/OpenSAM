{"name":"Opensam","tagline":"OpenSAM by OHM - 3D Printed Camera Stabilizer","body":"### OpenSAM\r\nIMAGE\r\nWelcome to OpenSAM, our 3Dprinted self-built three Axis stabilizer.\r\nIt is handheld and the entire mechanical construct is built using 3D printed parts. Brushless motors ensure the camera is stable and they can be controlled using a joystick. The design is developed by three engineering students at the Technical University of Denmark.\r\n\r\nNow gimbals like this may exist in plenty, but we think ours is unique because of its use of additive manufacturing. That makes the system very cheap to build and easy to reconstruct. All the files are open source and you can download them [here](https://github.com/OpenSAMOfficial/OpenSAM/zipball/master).\r\n\r\nCheck out our manual:\r\nLINK\r\n\r\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT](http://img.youtube.com/vi/_ByIIEwqBpo/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ByIIEwqBpo \"OpenSAM\")\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nOpenSAM was developed by OHM, Oliver Topp, Henning Si HÃ¸j and Mathias Grelck Johnsen from the Technical University of Denmark.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nContact us at contact@opensam.net if you have any questions.\r\n","google":"UA-63013096-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
